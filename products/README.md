The folders inside this folder should contain all the products of our project.

The `manuscript` folder contains the main manuscript for our project.

We placed supplementary information into the `supplement` folder. The `supplement` folder contains the Supplementary-Material.qmd file, which contains more in-depth information on our Exploratory Data Analysis, Methods, Modeling Analysis, and Machine Learning Models. 

We have a library of references in bibtex format, as well as a CSL style file that determines reference formatting. Those files might be used by several of the products and are placed into the `assets` folder.

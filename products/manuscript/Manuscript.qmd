Project Part 1: This dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/sleep-health-and-lifestyle/data) and was created by Mark Otto and Andrew Fong at MIT. The set has 373 observations for 13 variables covering a broad spectrum associated with sleep and daily routine. 

```{r}
#load in the data and check it out
library(here)
sleepdata <- read.csv(here("data","raw-data", "ss.csv"))
summary(sleepdata)
structure(sleepdata)
class(sleepdata)
```

We want to explore the influence of each variable on sleep quality and identify which ones seem to have the most impact (both positive and negative). We also wish to explore if certain variables affect male sleep quality more than females. If time allows, we'd also like to see if certain ages seem to be affected by certain variables more often than others. We can focus on every predictor in the dataset since there are only 13. 

We can likely use GLMs and t-tests/ANOVA tests to see the significance that variables may have in different combinations on an individual's sleep quality. Heat maps and various plots will also help with exploratory data analysis. We aren't exceptionally experienced with statistical analyses, but these are what we can think of at the moment.


End of Project Part 1

Project Part 2: 

We'll include the data cleaning here in order to generate our plots in this document. Please see the eda.qmd file for full exploratory results and the cleaning process.

```{r}
#load cleaning tools
library(tidyverse)
# Splitting the Blood.Pressure variable into systolic and diastolic variable columns
sleepdata <- sleepdata %>%
  separate(Blood.Pressure, into = c("systolic", "diastolic"), sep = "/")

# Ensuring that the new columns are considered numeric 
sleepdata$systolic <- as.numeric(sleepdata$systolic)
sleepdata$diastolic <- as.numeric(sleepdata$diastolic)

# Creating new categorical variable 

sleepdata <- sleepdata %>%
  mutate(cat_bp = case_when(
    systolic < 120 & diastolic < 80 ~ "Normal",
    systolic >= 120 & systolic <= 129 & diastolic < 80 ~ "Elevated",
    (systolic >= 130 & systolic <= 139) | (diastolic >= 80 & diastolic <= 89) ~ "Stage 1 Hypertension",
    systolic >= 140 | diastolic >= 90 ~ "Stage 2 Hypertension"
  ))
# Merging "Normal" and "Normal Weight" attributes into a singular "Normal" category

sleepdata <- sleepdata %>%
  mutate(BMI.Category = case_when(
    BMI.Category %in% c("Normal", "Normal Weight") ~ "Normal",
    BMI.Category == "Overweight" ~ "Overweight",
    BMI.Category == "Obese" ~ "Obese",
  ))
```

Here are the most interesting/distinct plots from the EDA: 

Physical Activity plot:

We can clearly see that Physical Activity level has a positive correlation with Quality of Sleep.
```{r}
#load plot package
library(ggplot2)

# Create a new variable for Physical Activity Level groups. Categorizes as "Low", "Medium", or "High"
sleepdata$PhysicalActivityGroup <- cut(sleepdata$Physical.Activity.Level, breaks = c(0, 30, 60, Inf), labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

# Box plot for Quality of Sleep by Physical Activity Level Group
ggplot(sleepdata, aes(x = PhysicalActivityGroup, y = Quality.of.Sleep)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Quality of Sleep by Physical Activity Level Group", x = "Physical Activity Level Group", y = "Quality of Sleep")
```

Gender, Age, and Occupation:

We can see some clear differences in self-reported Quality of Sleep between these different groups already.
Females tend to report an average of 1 higher according to the boxplot.
The different age groups are similar, but the oldest (50-60) reports the highest quality of sleep by far.
Our occupations are a bit all over the place, but Sales Representatives seem to have the worst average scores by far.
```{r}
# Boxplot for Quality of Sleep by Gender
ggplot(sleepdata, aes(x = Gender, y = Quality.of.Sleep)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Quality of Sleep by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Quality of Sleep")

# Create bins for Age in order to create a clean boxplot.
sleepdata$AgeGroup <- cut(sleepdata$Age, breaks = c(20, 30, 40, 50, 60), labels = c("20-30", "30-40", "40-50", "50-60"), include.lowest = TRUE)

# Calculate mean Quality of Sleep for each Age Group to plot with means for cleaner visuals
sleepdata_summary <- sleepdata %>%
  group_by(AgeGroup) %>%
  summarise(MeanQuality = mean(Quality.of.Sleep, na.rm = TRUE))

# Bar plot for Mean Quality of Sleep by Age Group with colorblind-friendly palette
ggplot(sleepdata_summary, aes(x = AgeGroup, y = MeanQuality, fill = AgeGroup)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(title = "Mean Quality of Sleep by Age Group", x = "Age Group", y = "Mean Quality of Sleep")

# Calculate mean Quality of Sleep for each Occupation in order to create a bar plot.
sleepdata_summary <- sleepdata %>%
  group_by(Occupation) %>%
  summarise(MeanQuality = mean(Quality.of.Sleep, na.rm = TRUE))

# Bar plot for Mean Quality of Sleep by Occupation with manually specified colors
ggplot(sleepdata_summary, aes(x = Occupation, y = MeanQuality, fill = Occupation)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rainbow(length(unique(sleepdata_summary$Occupation)))) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Mean Quality of Sleep by Occupation", x = "Occupation", y = "Mean Quality of Sleep")
```

BMI:
We can clearly see that Normal weights seem to have better sleep on average than the obese and overweight categories. However, there are very few in the obese category, so conclusions with that group may not be as supported as others.

```{r}
# Box plot for Quality of Sleep by BMI Category
ggplot(sleepdata, aes(x = BMI.Category, y = Quality.of.Sleep)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Quality of Sleep by BMI Category", x = "BMI Category", y = "Quality of Sleep")
```

Blood Pressure:

The boxplots look a bit strange for the Elevated and Normal levels, but we can see that it's likely due to a shortage of data for these categories. We can see, however, that Quality of Sleep does seem to be negatively correlated with increasing stages of hypertension.

```{r}
# Bar plot for cat_bp
ggplot(sleepdata, aes(x = cat_bp)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Bar Plot of cat_bp", x = "cat_bp", y = "Count")

# Box plot for Quality of Sleep by cat_bp
ggplot(sleepdata, aes(x = cat_bp, y = Quality.of.Sleep)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Quality of Sleep by cat_bp", x = "cat_bp", y = "Quality of Sleep")

```

And Stress Level:
Our scatterplot shows a clear negative correlation between Stress Level and Quality of Sleep. However, this is a subjective scale, so data should be taken with a grain of salt for now.

```{r}
# Scatterplot for Quality of Sleep by Stress Level
ggplot(sleepdata, aes(x = Stress.Level, y = Quality.of.Sleep)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(title = "Quality of Sleep by Stress Level", x = "Stress Level (scale: 1-10)", y = "Quality of Sleep")
```

The other plots were either self explanatory (e.g. Sleep Duration meant higher sleep quality) or had less defined trends (e.g. heart rate and daily steps).

# Summary/Abstract
_Write a summary of your project._


{{< pagebreak >}}


# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

## Description of data and data source
_Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section._

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a].



{{< pagebreak >}}


# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._


## Schematic of workflow

Sometimes you might want to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if you can do it with code, do it). is an example of some - completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with Biorender.
We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
#knitr::include_graphics(here("products","antigen-recognition.png"))
```




## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


 shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
#resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
#knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
#knitr::include_graphics(here("results","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Exampleshows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
#resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
#knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper  discusses types of analyses. 

These papers  are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.

	abstract = {Background. Studies on bidirectional associations between hypertension and insomnia are inconclusive. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically review and summarize the current evidence from epidemiological studies that evaluated this relationship. Materials and Methods. PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang, and VIP databases were searched for studies published up to May 2021. Prospective cohort studies that reported the relationship between hypertension and insomnia in adults were included. Data were extracted or provided by the authors according to the prevalence rate, incidence rate, unadjusted or adjusted odds ratio (OR), and 95\% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistics. ORs were pooled by using random-effects models. Results. A total of 23 prospective studies were identified. Twenty cohort studies recorded OR-adjusted value with the outcome for hypertension (OR = 1.11, 95\% CI: 1.07–1.16; I2 = 83.9\%), and three cohort studies reported OR-adjusted value with the outcome for insomnia (OR = 1.20, 95\%CI: 1.08–1.32; I2 = 35.1\%). Subgroup analysis showed that early morning awakening and composite insomnia were significantly associated with hypertension. Conclusions. The result indicates a possible bidirectional association between hypertension and insomnia. Early identification and prevention of insomnia in hypertension patients are needed, and vice versa.},

	abstract = {Background: To evaluate the association of sleep factors (sleep duration, self-reported trouble sleeping, diagnosed sleep disorder) and combined sleep behaviors with the risk of hypertension. Methods: We analyzed 12,166 adults aged 30–79 years who participated in the 2007–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sleep duration, self-reported trouble sleeping and sleep disorders were collected using a standardized questionnaire. We included three sleep factors (sleep duration, self-reported trouble sleeping and sleep disorder) to generate an overall sleep score, ranging from 0 to 3. We then defined the sleep pattern as “healthy sleep pattern” (overall sleep score = 3), “intermediate sleep pattern” (overall sleep score = 2), and “poor sleep pattern” (0 ≤ overall sleep score ≤ 1) based on the overall sleep score. The definition of hypertension was based on self-reported antihypertensive medication use or biological measurement (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg). We used weighted logistic regression models to investigate the associations between sleep and hypertension. Results: The overall prevalence of hypertension was 37.8\%. A short sleep duration (OR = 1.20, 95\% CI: 1.08 to 1.33, p = 0.001), self-reported trouble sleeping (OR = 1.45, 95\% CI: 1.28 to 1.65, p {\textless} 0.001) and sleep disorder (OR = 1.33, 95\% CI: 1.07 to 1.66, p = 0.012) were related to the risk of hypertension. Poor sleep patterns were closely correlated with the risk of hypertension (OR = 1.90, 95\% CI: 1.62 to 2.24). Conclusions: Participants with poor sleep patterns were associated with an increased risk for hypertension.},

This folder contains results produced by the code, such as figures and tables, and other files.

A special folder for large files exists. This folder is set in .gitignore to be ignored when pushing/pulling. This allows large files to be part of the project. If you want to collaborate with someone or work on multiple computers, you need to manually share/transfer everything in this folder, e.g. by Dropbox/OneDrive/etc.

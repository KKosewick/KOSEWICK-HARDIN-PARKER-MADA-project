This folder contains code to do some simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the processed/cleaned data.
The 'eda.qmd' file contains the code and text with interpretations and explanations of the data.
The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the appropriate `figure-html' sub-folder.
